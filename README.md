### SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
## Aim
I have tried to create multiple samples using different sampling techniques and applied different machine learning models to decide which gives the best output

## Sampling Methods Used
I have used the following sampling methods:-
- Simple Random Sampling
- Systematic Sampling
- Stratified Sampling
- Cluster Sampling 

## Models
I have tried to use pycaret to see the difference in the accuracy of different models when applied on a particular sample generated by one of the sampling methods.
I have concluded that AdaBoost Regressor gives the best accuracy for most of the samples.
